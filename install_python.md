The preferred method of installation is through the conda package system. There are two options. Anaconda and miniconda. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a complete distribution of python containing a very rich collection of most commonly useful packages for developing and scientific programming.

For some computers anaconda might be too heavy to install. For these computers a better options is to install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) which is a minimum python/conda installation with all necessary packages. Despite the "minimum" nature of miniconda, it contains all tools and commands to install any other package so it is preferable in cases where we want to "build" a new python environment "bottom-up".
